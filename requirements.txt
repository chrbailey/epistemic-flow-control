# Epistemic Flow Control - Core Dependencies
#
# The core library has NO required dependencies (uses Python standard library only).
# Install optional dependencies for additional features:
#
#   pip install -r requirements.txt              # Core only (this file)
#   pip install -r requirements-llm.txt          # + LLM integration
#   pip install -r requirements-demo.txt         # + Interactive demo
#   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt          # + Development tools
#
# Or install everything:
#   pip install -e ".[all]"

# No core dependencies - pure Python standard library!
# This is intentional for maximum portability.
